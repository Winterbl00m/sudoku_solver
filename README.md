# sudoku_solver

## About the Project
This is a backtracking algorithm to solve a n-by-n Sudoku grid. It is adapted from a sudoku solver creation tutorial from techwithtim, but changed to solve non 9 by 9 Sudoku boards.

Example of how to input Sudoku boards to the solver can be found in solver.py

## How to Run Code
run `pip instal -r requiremenats.txt`
run `solver.py`
